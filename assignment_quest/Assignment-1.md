## Decision Making:-

* Biggest of three/four numbers
* Check if given number is armstrong or not
* Reverse the number, sum of digits
* GCD/HCF of two numbers
* LCM without computing GCD/HCF
* Check if given year is Leap year or not
* Type of triangle - equilateral, isosceles, scalene, right angled
* Roots of a quadratic equation
* Quadrant of a given point (x,y)
* Choice based arithmetic
* Check if given character is vowel or consonant
* choice based arithmetic


## Loops:-
* Fibonacci sequence, Tribonacci series
* Factorial of a given number
* Sum of the factors, n=30, 1+2+3+5+6+10+15
* Digital root of a given number, 7895 -> 29 -> 11 -> 2
* List/count of prime numbers for given range
* Sum of triangular numbers, n=4, 1 + (1+2) + (1+2+3) + (1+2+3+4) = 20
* Maximum number by deleting single digit in a 4 digit number
     5872  - 872,   9865 - 985
* Generate super prime numbers
* No.of combinations for n teams to play each other,  i.e. nCr
* Generate number triangles/pyramids, pascal triangle
